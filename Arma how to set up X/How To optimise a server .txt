This is a heavily edited extract from a discussion on the Skype channel between B.I and server admins.

This is basically a methodology to optimise a server

Set The following bandwidth as follows

For a 1 Gbps connection:

Maxbandwidth: 1073741824

Minbandwidth: 107374182

For a 100 Mbps connection:

Maxbandwidth: 104857600

Minbandwidth: 10485760

Then:

Set Maxmsgsend at 2048, lower by 256 until it's ok
Set MaxSizeGuaranteed=958; or lower by 64 until it's ok
Set MaxSizeNonguaranteed=224; increase by 16 until it's ok
for METS/METSN use either default or 2x
MinErrorToSend=0.002;
MinErrorToSendNear=0.02;(tho quite admins use even higher values 3-12x default
Additional notes:

If there are more instances of a ArmA3 server on the same box, to play safe you would split the Min and Max bandwidth appriopriately, although because the RV engine does not use all the bandwidth available on such connections anyway, it shouldn't really matter
MinerrorX settings are often ignored if there are special events triggering the update on object
The RV engine autodetects and adjusts unknown elements using it's internal optimisation system
Settings will vary from server to server depending on but not inclusive of the following
Type of mission, eg Coop/PvP
Number of players and quality of their connection to the server
Hardware capabilities of clients and server
Quality of connection of clients and server
It would be good to get some feedback on this methodology if anyone trys it

To maintain some form of comparison, I've uploaded a modified patrol ops pack, which doesnt require any addons.

Use this to get a comparison, its fairly popular so you should get a decent player base for it.
